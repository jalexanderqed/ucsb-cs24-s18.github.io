  <b> Jack Alexander (TA) </b>
  <i> "Hey, my name is Jack, and I’ve been looking forward to TAing this class for the whole year! I’m a master’s student in the Computer Science BS/MS program, where you get a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in five years (highly recommended). In the past, I’ve mentored in CS56 and CS190I, and last quarter I TAed CS184. As I said, I’ve wanted to TA an introductory CS class for quite a while, and I can’t wait to help guide you through the more advanced elements of C++ as well as your first complex data structures. Linked lists and binary search trees had something of a magical quality for me when I first learned them three years ago, and I hope you will have a similarly enthralling experience in this course" </i>

  <b> Sayali Kakade (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi everyone, I’m so excited to be one of your tutors for this upcoming quarter! I know this class can be daunting at times, and I’d love to help you with any concept that you might be unclear about, figure out how to approach the PAs, or even give you career or college advice (classes to take, internship advice, things unrelated to academics, etc). <br> This class will set the foundation for your classes in the future so it’s very important to understand the material, and even if you need to ask the same question multiple times to really drive a point home, I never want you to feel afraid to ask me anything! If you see me around campus, feel free to say hi or reach out to me on Piazza. Hope you have a great quarter! :)" </i>

  <b> Bryanna Phan (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi everyone, my name is Bryanna and I’m very excited to be a tutor this quarter! You’ll probably see me at Coders SB meetings, so ask me about our events if you’re looking to get more involved on campus whether it be through this club, SB Hacks or the other wide variety of options. This quarter I’d definitely like to focus on helping students to solidify their problem-solving skills and to not be daunted by the programming assignments (trust me, I know how that can feel). Outside of class, I really love traveling, dogs, ping pong/badminton (even tho I’m not great), and tea :-) Feel free to reach out with any questions you may have on Piazza." </i>

  <b>  Abhishek	Bhattacharya (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi! My name is  Abhishek, I am a 4th year CCS Computing and Biology double major. I am super excited to be one of the mentors for CS24. Here’s a little background about me:  In the last few years I have been lucky enough to have worked with leading scientists at Stanford, UCSF and UCSB to uncover the potential of big data in computational biology. My interests lie in deep learning precision interpretation of medical imaging for the clinics. I have been involved with a number of ongoing projects in skin and breast cancer quantitative image analysis. If any of you also like these topics or just want to chat, don’t hesitate to contact me on Piazza :) " </i>
