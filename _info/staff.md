    <b>Nidhi Hiremath (TA)</b>
    <i> "Hi everyone! I'm Nidhi, a first year Masters Student in the CS department. I am excited to help you better understand computer programming with C++ and build exciting projects. I built most of my first projects in C++ and would be happy to help you do the same. I'm into interdisciplinary research, so if that's something you might be interested in, I'd be happy to share my experiences. In my spare time, I enjoy destroying my sleep cycle with TV shows and weight-lifting. I'm always open to discussing anything you might need help with, like choosing classes, getting involved in research labs or just about anything, feel free to reach out to me on Piazza" </i>

  <b> Jack Alexander (TA) </b>
  <i> "Hey, my name is Jack, and I’ve been looking forward to TAing this class for the whole year! I’m a master’s student in the Computer Science BS/MS program, where you get a Bachelor’s and a Master’s degree in five years (highly recommended). In the past, I’ve mentored in CS56 and CS190I, and last quarter I TAed CS184. As I said, I’ve wanted to TA an introductory CS class for quite a while, and I can’t wait to help guide you through the more advanced elements of C++ as well as your first complex data structures. Linked lists and binary search trees had something of a magical quality for me when I first learned them three years ago, and I hope you will have a similarly enthralling experience in this course" </i>

    <b> Shreyas CR (Tutor)   </b>
    <i> " I'm super glad I can be one of your tutors for CS24 this quarter. In CS24 you'll start learning how to apply all the problem solving skills you've learned in the past, and get a quick intro to more complex data structures. It may be a bit scary at first (we've all been there!), but overtime you'll learn a lot and come to love CS even more! This quarter, you'll see me running around at SB Hacks IV and SASE West Regional Conference, so don't be afraid to say hi!! If you want to learn more about getting involved in UCSB club organizations and landing super cool internships for the summer, feel free to talk to me during class or when you see me in the library (I don’t mind getting distracted haha). I've gone through it all, and I don't mind helping out where I can~ :) Aside from UCSB and CS, I love to explore/travel, hike, and spend as much time outside as I can (can't beat the Cali sun).

  <b> Sayali Kakade (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi everyone, I’m so excited to be one of your tutors for this upcoming quarter! I know this class can be daunting at times, and I’d love to help you with any concept that you might be unclear about, figure out how to approach the PAs, or even give you career or college advice (classes to take, internship advice, things unrelated to academics, etc). <br> This class will set the foundation for your classes in the future so it’s very important to understand the material, and even if you need to ask the same question multiple times to really drive a point home, I never want you to feel afraid to ask me anything! If you see me around campus, feel free to say hi or reach out to me on Piazza. Hope you have a great quarter! :)" </i>

  <b> Bryanna Phan (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi everyone, my name is Bryanna and I’m very excited to be a tutor this quarter! You’ll probably see me at Coders SB meetings, so ask me about our events if you’re looking to get more involved on campus whether it be through this club, SB Hacks or the other wide variety of options. This quarter I’d definitely like to focus on helping students to solidify their problem-solving skills and to not be daunted by the programming assignments (trust me, I know how that can feel). Outside of class, I really love traveling, dogs, ping pong/badminton (even tho I’m not great), and tea :-) Feel free to reach out with any questions you may have on Piazza." </i>

  <b> Bryan Wu (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Welcome to CS 24 everyone! I’m a second-year Computer Science (CS) major. I tutored for CS 8 Fall 2017, and I’m excited to return for another opportunity to directly support fellow coders! Additionally, I would be glad to be of assistance if any of you have questions about switching into the CS major in the College of Engineering. I came into UCSB as an Economics major and made the switch to CS at the end of the Spring quarter of my first year. The process of switching into CS was a challenging struggle that grew on me initially as a dreadful archenemy, but ended up as a very close friend of mine who polished my study and life skills. On a side note, I enjoy hanging around and sleeping in cafes, traveling, gaming, playing the piano, and taking pictures. Contact me on Piazza if you have any questions about CS, or just want to chat (no Game of Thrones spoilers)! " </i>

  <b>  Areg	Nersisyan(Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi everyone, I’m one of your mentors for CS 24. I’m a junior here at UCSB studying CS. Prior to mentoring for a class, I’ve done private tutoring for 4 years and realized I enjoy helping others learn. I’ll be glad to discuss any questions you have and help you find further resources if the need be. My goal is to help you fill in any knowledge gaps, since I think by having a strong foundation in the topics makes the rest easier. Outside of CS24 questions I’ll be glad to help anyone with planning out class schedules, telling my experiences in classes I’ve had. Those interested about summertime internships, I’ll also try to give my best advice on prep and approaches to answering questions. Besides CS, I like spending my personal time swimming, going to the gym, playing video games and sleeping, a lot of sleeping. So that said, if you like to talk to me, let me know in person or via Piazza. I will typically get back to you by end of the day, but if there’s anything urgent or you don’t want to wait, let me know beforehand in person and I’ll make sure to stay more alert about your email.

I’m a third year CS student, and also a 2017 and 2018 Amazon Software Development Engineer Intern. My hobbies outside of CS include hiking, photography, and cooking. Feel free to come to me with any questions about CS, interviewing, working in the industry, or anything else on your mind. You can reach me anytime at scottdemoney@umail.ucsb.edu " </i>

  <b>  Robert	Stosick (Tutor)    </b>
  <i> "Hi there! My name is Robert, my pronouns are he/him/his. I am excited to be one of your mentors for CS 24. I am a senior here, studying Computer Engineering. This is my first time mentoring, but I have been very grateful for all of the TAs who have helped me throughout my time at UCSB, and I am excited to give back by having the opportunity to help you grow and develop your coding skills.

  In CS 24 you will have the opportunity to continue honing your programming skills, develop new ones, and really begin to get into Computer Science in greater depth. It is of course important to learn the course material, but I believe it is equally important to develop good coding habits early on in your CS education, because long after the specific details of what you learned in CS 24 are fuzzy, you will keep using the skills you learned.

  For non-CS majors, taking CS 24 will teach you coding skills that are valuable and give you a competitive advantage over peers who do not have these skills, and will give you a solid foundation in Computer Science (the same foundation that CS and CE majors receive) should you wish to continue learning to code in the future. With the rise of Big Data and the Internet of Things, knowing how to code is more valuable than ever in many fields.

  I imagine that the course may be tough, especially so for students who may not have had much or any programming experience prior to CS 8 and CS 16, but I will do my best to guide you through the challenges. I was once in that boat, and I am confident that you will succeed too. I will do my best to help make your journey as smooth as possible.
  I can also answer lots of questions about other CS classes here at UCSB. Please feel free to ask me questions, even if it seems like a silly question. I look forward to seeing you in lab." </i>

  <b> Claudia Zeng (Tutor) </b>
  <i> "Hi, I’m Claudia (Yuqing) Zeng (she/her/hers) and I’m a 2nd year computer science major student. I was the tutor for last quarter CS8 and I’m really excited to be your CS24 mentor for this quarter. I will be the first person you contact whenever you have problems. It could be the lab assignments, homework, or anything you want to know about computer science major, or me. I will also offer feedback on your code.

More personally, I was the software engineer in InitialView. Beside this course, I’m also working for Coastal Oceanography & Autonomous Systems Lab on campus. COAST built a cataraft docked with the Autonomous Underwater Vehicles to protect it. By using this cataraft, we collect information from ocean for research. I work on the cataraft interface with the REMUS 600, including wifi, bluetooth and sonar. I also do Android app design, machine learning through python, VR game design using Unity, robotics using C++, and some other stuff. Other than that, since I changed my major from math to computer science, I can share my experience on that. If you have any questions about changing majors, feel free to reach me. My open lab hours will be on Thursday from 12:30-1:30pm, and on Friday from 3-5pm. Or you can make an appointment by sending me a Piazza post.

Hope we all have a wonderful quarter!" </i>

  <i> "Hi! My name is  Abhishek, I am a 4th year CCS Computing and Biology double major. I am super excited to be one of the mentors for CS24. Here’s a little background about me:  In the last few years I have been lucky enough to have worked with leading scientists at Stanford, UCSF and UCSB to uncover the potential of big data in computational biology. My interests lie in deep learning precision interpretation of medical imaging for the clinics. I have been involved with a number of ongoing projects in skin and breast cancer quantitative image analysis. If any of you also like these topics or just want to chat, don’t hesitate to contact me on Piazza :) " </i>
