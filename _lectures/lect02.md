# Code from lecture:

# Topics

* Intro to lab01 and pa01
* Implementing classes: class vs instance, syntax for classes, scope, methods, instance variables
* We examine the differences and similarities between a procedural implementation and a OOP style program by coding up a game involving rolling a pair of die

* Classes: structs but with methods
* Accessors and modifiers
* When to use classes, how many? The dangers of overobjectification (too many classes)
* ADT (Abstract Data Type) ~ class (w/ info hiding) for use by other programmers
