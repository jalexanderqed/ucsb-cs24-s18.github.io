  <li>Create a github repo following the correct naming convention.</li>
  <li>If you have a partner, add you partner as a collaborator to the repo. Partner should accept the invitations to complete this process</li>
  <li>Join a team on submit.cs</li>
  <li>No starter code is provided for this lab</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="goal-of-this-assignment">Goal of this assignment</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Practice using Binary Search Trees</li>
  <li>Learn to organize a project’s code structure on your own (not just filling in a template)</li>
  <li>Learn to design classes using good OOP design principles discussed in class</li>
  <li>Learn to refactor an existing solution to  improve its design</li>
  <li>Learn to practice defensive coding strategies</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="instructions">Instructions</h1>

<p>The game you will be implementing is exactly the same as the one you did for pa02, the key differences are:
* you will implement and use a binary search tree instead of a linked list
* you will organize your code in a slightly different directory structure</p>

<h1 id="required-files">Required files</h1>

<ul>
  <li>cards.cpp, cards.h    // These files should contain  your implementation of the binary search tree to stror a list of cards</li>
  <li>ultility.cpp, ultility.h // These files should contain any other classes that you need to implement your game,</li>
  <li>tests.cpp // These files should contain test code for all the classes and methods you used in your game</li>
  <li>main.cpp // This file should read in the cards of the two players from input files and put everything together to play the game.</li>
  <li>Makefile // generate two execuatables- the first should be called game and behaves exactly as the one in pa02, the second should be called tests and must run all the test code to unit test your classes and methods</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-game">The game</h2>

<p>Alice and Bob have realized the simplicity of their revealed-hand version of Go Fish and figured out that they probably should play with their hands concealed. However, they’ve already delt two hands of cards and decide to play one last game with revealed hands and make it as fast as possible. To aid this, they decide to play the game exactly the same way as described in pa02 except they will go through their cards in sorted order.</p>

<p>The game proceeds much as in the previous assignment, with Alice taking her turn and then Bob taking his turn. However, now when asking for cards, Alice proceeds FORWARD starting with “lowest” card and proceeding to the “highest” card, while Bob proceeds BACKWARDS through his cards in sorted order.</p>

<p>The ordering of cards is described in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="card-ordering">Card ordering</h2>

<p>The ordering of cards is determined first by its suit and then by the value:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The ordering least to greatest is: clubs, diamonds, spades, hearts. This a club of any value is less than a diamond of any value</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ordering within each suit is determined by the value from least to greatest as follows: 
ace, 2, 3, . . . 10, jack, queen, king.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Based on the above two rules, the correct ordering of</p>

<p>h 9, c k, s 3, c a, h j, d 3</p>

<p>would be</p>

<p>c a, c k, d 3, s 3, h 9, h j</p>

<h2 id="your-approach">Your approach</h2>

<p>At the start of the program, you will read in Alice and Bob’s starting hands from two files. The names of these files are provided as command line arguments with Alice’s file in <code class="highlighter-rouge">argv[1]</code> and Bob’s in <code class="highlighter-rouge">argv[2]</code>. The starter code opens the files for you as <code class="highlighter-rouge">ifstream</code> objects, which you can treat much like <code class="highlighter-rouge">cin</code>. You should read Alice and Bob’s cards into two binary search trees. Don’t worry about balancing the binary search trees (though you can try and optimize this if you like). Your binary search tree class should obey the card ordering rules given above. While implementing this, you may find it helpful to overload the operators <code class="highlighter-rouge">==</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> on your card class so that you can easily choose which branches to go down on your binary tree. Note that you need to correctly handle the case of cards with the value 10 (which has two characters) and separately compare the value and suit, so storing the cards as strings is probably not the best approach.</p>

<p>Once you have the sets of cards, the game begins. Alice iterates forward through her binary tree (in increasing order of the cards), checking whether Bob has that card. You should check if Bob has each card using the search function of the BST. Once a matching card is found, you should print the line “Alice picked matching card <card suit="" as="" a="" character=""> &lt;card value as a number/character&gt;". The card should then be removed from both players hands by calling delete on the binary search tree. Make sure to delete any dynamically allocated memory when removing the cards from your trees!</card></p>

<p>The process then repeats, except this time, Bob looks through his cards starting with largest card and working towards the smallest card. This means that while the first card Alice finds should be the first shared card (in order), the first card Bob finds should be the last shared card (in order). Once there are no matching cards, you should print out the final hands of both players with the matching cards removed.</p>

<p>As before, you should write your own Makefile for this lab so that running <code class="highlighter-rouge">make</code> builds an executable called <code class="highlighter-rouge">game</code>.</p>

<h2 id="before-you-begin">Before you begin</h2>

<p>Based on pa02, we are adding an additional requirement that you write a set of unit tests for your binary search tree. These should be in a file called <code class="highlighter-rouge">tests.cpp</code>, which you will submit, and you should write your Makefile so that running <code class="highlighter-rouge">make test</code> compiles and runs these tests. Note that there will be no submit.cs tests for these unit tests, so you can have the output in whatever format you find most helpful. You should test each of the functions on your binary search tree, which will include, at the very least, <code class="highlighter-rouge">find()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">delete()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">insert()</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">successor()</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">predecessor()</code>. We recommend writing these tests BEFORE you begin implementing the full game to ensure that your binary search tree works correctly. Debugging one set of code is much easier than debugging two at the same time. This will also ensure that your are correctly separating your binary tree class from the rest of your program logic.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Contents of <code class="highlighter-rouge">alice_cards.txt</code>:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
h 3
s 10
c a
c 3
s 5
h 10
d a
</code></p>

<p>Contents of <code class="highlighter-rouge">bob_cards.txt</code>:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">
c 2
d a
h 10
c 3
d j
s 10
h a
</code></p>

<p>Correct output after running <code class="highlighter-rouge">make &amp;&amp; ./game alice_cards.txt bob_cards.txt</code>:
```
Alice picked matching card c 3
Bob picked matching card h 10
Alice picked matching card d a
Bob picked matching card s 10</p>

<p>Alice’s cards:
c a
s 5
h 3</p>

<p>Bob’s cards:
c 2
d j
h a
```</p>

<p>Note: a=ace, k=king, q=queen, j=jack</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<p>For this lab, you will have a lot of flexibility on your implementation (which just means we won’t be providing a code framework for you to fill in). However, there are a few requirements that your mentor will check for when they look at your code. Keep these in mind as you think about your solution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You must use a binary search tree you implemented yourself to solve the problem, not another data structure or a class in the standard library.</li>
  <li>Your binary search tree must implement a constructor, a destructor and other other methods as needed</li>
  <li>You code should be readable</li>
  <li>Your classes should define clear interfaces and hide implementation details as much as possible.</li>
  <li>Your program must properly free all memory it allocates, including your binary tree nodes and any dynamically allocated data stored inside them. We will also check this with valgrind when you turn in your code to submit.cs.</li>
  <li>You do not need to worry about having multiple instances of the same card. Each card will appear only once per hand.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="submission-instructions">Submission instructions</h1>
<p>Submit your code using the following command</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>~submit/submit -p 968 Makefile cards.cpp cards.h main.cpp tests.cpp utility.cpp utility.h
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>You should also commit and push your code to github.</p>

<h2 id="files-to-submit">Files to submit</h2>

<p>You must organize your program in the files: main.cpp, cards.cpp, tests.cpp, cards.h, utility.cpp and utility.h
In addition you must create a Makefile that compiles your program to an executable called <code class="highlighter-rouge">game</code>
You can use the utility.cpp and .h to organize any additional classes.</p>
