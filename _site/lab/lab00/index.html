          <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Your first lab for this week is an introduction to your mentor group and programming on CSIL and in the Computer Science (Phelps) lab. The intended outcomes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get to know the course staff and help us get to know you</li>
  <li>Learn about the tools we will be using in this class: gradescope and github</li>
</ul>

<p>This lab must be completed INDIVIDUALLY. In the subsequent labs you are encouraged to work with your programming partner.</p>

<h1 id="tell-us-about-yourself">Tell us about yourself</h1>

<p>Please fill out the following form to tell us about yourself. We will use the information to pair you with your preferred programming partner or someone in the class with the similar skill levels as your self. Here is the link to the form <a href="http://bit.ly/CS24-ic00-AboutYou">http://bit.ly/CS24-ic00-AboutYou</a></p>

<p>Answer all the questions in the form to earn credit for this part (50 points).</p>

<h1 id="get-setup-with-the-tools-for-this-course">Get setup with the tools for this course</h1>

<h2 id="create-a-coe-account-if-you-dont-have-one-already">Create a CoE account if you don’t have one already</h2>

<p>We encourage you to complete all programming assignments by logging in to the machines in the Computer Science labs, or to connect remotely. To do this you will need a <strong>College of Engineering account</strong>. You can create an account online at <a href="https://accounts.engr.ucsb.edu/create" target="_blank">https://accounts.engr.ucsb.edu/create</a>.</p>

<p>If you are enrolled in <i>any</i> CoE course this quarter (including CS24), you can create your account immediately. If you are not, you will need to contact the ECI Help Desk at <a href="mailto:help@engineering.ucsb.edu">help@engineering.ucsb.edu</a>.</p>

<h2 id="get-setup-with-github">Get setup with github</h2>

<p>We will be using github.com in this course.   We have created an organization called ucsb-cs24-s18 on github.com where you can create repositories (repos) for your assignments in this course.   The advantage of creating private repos under that organization is that the course staff (your instructors, TAs and mentors) will be able to see your code and provide you with help, without you having to do anything special.</p>

<p>To join this organization, you need to do three things.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If you don’t already have a github.com account, create one on the “free” plan. Visit <a href="www.github.com">www.github.com</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you don’t already have your @umail.ucsb.edu email address associated with your github.com account. go to “settings”, add that email, and confirm that email address.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Visit <a href="https://ucsb-cs-github-linker.herokuapp.com/">our Github Sign Up Tool</a>, login with your github.com account, click “Home”, find this course (CS24-S18), and click the “join course button”.   That will automatically send you an invitation to join the course organization on github.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Accept the invitation that appears in your browser (from step 3) or log into your account on <a href="www.github.com">www.github.com</a> to accept the invitation.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="get-setup-with-gradescope">Get setup with gradescope</h2>

<p>We will use gradescope to grade all your homeworks, exams and lab/programming assignments. You should have received an email notification with instructions about logging into gradescope.</p>

<p>Log into our class site: CS24 Spring 2018 and navigate to the lab00 assignment</p>

<h1 id="implement-and-submit-a-simple-c-program">Implement and submit a simple C++ program</h1>

<h2 id="open-a-terminal-and-write-a-simple-hello-world-program">Open a Terminal and write a simple “Hello World” program</h2>

<p>Open a <strong>terminal window</strong>, which will be the environment you use to write, compile, and run your programs.</p>

<p>If you are working on your laptop, whether Windows, Mac or Linux, the instructions below will tell you how to connect to <code class="highlighter-rouge">csil.cs.ucsb.edu</code>. For now its okay to connect to that server, however in the future please connect to one of the following machines:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">csil-01.cs.ucsb.edu</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">csil-02.cs.ucsb.edu</code>, etc.</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
  <li>through <code class="highlighter-rouge">csil-48.cs.ucsb.edu</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll get much better performance on those individual machines, because they are much less heavily loaded and have newer hardware, as compared to <code class="highlighter-rouge">csil.cs.ucsb.edu</code>.</p>

<h2 id="create-cs24-and-lab00-directories">Create cs24 and lab00 directories</h2>

<p>Now that your environment is set up, you will need to create a directory that will contain all your work for the course. Then, inside that directory, you will need to create another directory to contain your work for this assignment.</p>

<p>To create your CS24 directory, use the <b>mkdir</b> command. Type the following in the terminal and press enter:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ mkdir cs24
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Change into that directory and create a lab00 directory</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ mkdir lab00
$ cd lab00   
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Create a new file called <code>hello.cpp</code> using an editor of your choice (either vim or emacs)</p>

<ul>
  <li>To customize your vim environment for a better coding experience with C/C++ copy this .vimrc file from the instructor folder to your home folder using the following command:</li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>cp /cs/faculty/dimirza/vim-configuration/example_dotvimrc/.vimrc ~/

<p>This assignment only needs you to write a program in hello.cpp that prints out two lines on the display, and nothing else. <strong>The output should look exactly as follows</strong> (no space before or after each line, except the 2 newlines):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Hello, world!
I am ready for CS24!
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="create-a-repo-on-github-in-our-class-organization">Create a repo on github in our class organization</h2>

<p>For this lab and all subsequent programming assignments, you should start by creating a repo in the ucsb-cs24-s18 organization following these steps</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Navigate to your dashboard on <a href="www.github.com">www.github.com</a>. From the left drop down menu, select the class organization as shown in the figure below:
<img src="/lab/lab00/select-org.png" alt="select-org" height="500px" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Click on the green “New repository” button to create a new repository.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Type the name of your repo following the naming convention lab00_your-github-username. For example if your github username is jgaucho, you should name your repo as lab00_jgaucho. If you are working with a partner, include your partner’s github username in the name of the repo. e.g. lab00_jgaucho_alily</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the “Private” visibility option so that other students in the org cannot view your code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the C++ .ignore option from the frop down menu and click on “Create repository”. See screenshot below.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/lab/lab00/enter-org/pic5.png" alt="new-repo" height="500px" /></p>

<h2 id="upload-your-code-using-githubs-web-interface">Upload your code using github’s web interface</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Upload your hello.cpp file to the new repo you created in the previous step. To do this, you should be physically present on a lab machine or in CSIL where you have access to a web browser and a local copy of your hello.cpp program. On your web browser, navigate to your repo on github. Click on the “Upload files” button.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now either drag and drop the “hello.cpp” file from your machine or use the “Choose your files” option to browse through your local directory and upload the file. Then press the green “Commit new files” button. Navigate back to your repo to see that the hello.cpp file is correctly listed along with the other files. Click on it and you should see your code on github’s web interface. Continue to explore the web interface of your github repo. For example, try clicking on the “commits” link in your repo. What does that show you and what do you think it means?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="submit-your-program-for-grading-to-gradescope">Submit your program for grading to gradescope</h2>

<p>It’s time to submit your program to gradescope. Go to <a href="www.gradescope.com">www.gradescope.com</a>. Log into our class website. Select this assignment. Then click on the “Submit” button on the bottom right corner.</p>

<p>You will be given the option of directly uploading files from your local machine or submitting the code in a github repo. We recommend that you submit via github as shown in the figure below. This will ensure that our staff sees the version of the code that you submitted for grading on github.</p>

<p><img src="/lab/lab00/enter-org/gradescope-submission.png" alt="submit" height="500px" /></p>

<p>Congratulations on completing the workflow for CS24 programming assignments using the tools that we will be using in this class i.e. gradescope and github. In the next labs we will integrate the command line interface of github into this workflow</p>
