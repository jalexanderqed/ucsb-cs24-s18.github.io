          <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Your first lab for this week is an introduction to your mentor group and programming on CSIL and in the Computer Science (Phelps) lab. The intended outcomes are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Selecting a mentor and pair programming partner</li>
  <li>Writing a simple C++ program</li>
  <li>Learning about github’s web interface</li>
</ul>

<p>This lab must be completed INDIVIDUALLY. In the subsequent labs you are encouraged to work with your programming partner.</p>

<h2 id="get-to-know-your-mentor-and-programming-partner">Get to know your mentor and programming partner:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Take note of your course mentor and pair programming partner at  <a href="/info/mentor_groups/">mentor group</a>. Get to know your mentor:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Read your [mentor’s profile] (/info/staff/)</li>
      <li>Meet them during the open lab hours on Thursday or Friday. The exact time and location can be found at <a href="/info/schedule/">lab and office hours schedule</a></li>
      <li>Contact your mentor via Piazza or email to confirm your meeting in Week1. During your meeting, set up a time when you can regularly meet for the remainder of the quarter. Your mentor will send you feedback on your work to your umail account. Make sure your line of communication with your mentor is working and talk about any preferences you may have. Your mentor will be your first point of contact for the quarter!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Connect with your programming partner via email or in person and determine times when you can work together outside the prescribed lab hours. You will need to set aside 2 to 3 hours each week to work on assignments. Get your partner’s contact: phone number or email.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="open-a-terminal-and-write-a-simple-hello-world-program-a-namestep2a">Open a Terminal and write a simple “Hello World” program <a name="step2"></a></h2>

<p>Open a <b>terminal window</b>, which will be the environment you use to write, compile, and run your programs.</p>

<p>If you are working on your laptop, whether Windows, Mac or Linux, the instructions below
will tell you how to connect to <code class="highlighter-rouge">csil.cs.ucsb.edu</code>. For now its okay to connect to that server, however in the future please connect to one of the following machines:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">csil-01.cs.ucsb.edu</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">csil-02.cs.ucsb.edu</code>, etc.</li>
  <li>etc.</li>
  <li>through <code class="highlighter-rouge">csil-48.cs.ucsb.edu</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll get much better performance on those individual machines, because they are much less heavily loaded and have newer hardware, as compared to <code class="highlighter-rouge">csil.cs.ucsb.edu</code>.</p>

<h2 id="create-cs24-and-lab00-directoriesa-namestep3a">Create cs24 and lab00 directories<a name="step3"></a></h2>

<p>Now that your environment is set up, you will need to create a directory that will contain all your work for the course. Then, inside that directory, you will need to create another directory to contain your work for this assignment.</p>

<p>To create your CS24 directory, use the <b>mkdir</b> command. Type the following in the terminal and press enter:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ mkdir cs24
</code></pre>
</div>
<p>Change into that directory and create a lab00 directory</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ mkdir lab00
$ cd lab00   
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Open an editor of your choice (either vim or emacs)</p>

<p>Useful links related to emacs</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>* &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/tour/" target="_blank"&gt;emacs tour from the GNU organization (makers of emacs)&lt;/a&gt;

<p>This assignment only needs you to write a program that prints out two lines on the display, and nothing else. <b>The output should look exactly as follows</b> (no space before or after each line, except the 2 newlines):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>Hello, world!
I am ready for CS24!
</code></pre>
</div>

<h2 id="submit-your-program-for-grading-a-namestep7a">Submit your program for grading <a name="step7"></a></h2>

<p>Once you are satisfied that your program is correct, then it’s time to submit it.</p>

<p><strong>Please remember that you must submit the program to obtain any credit for the assignment; just completing the program is not enough.</strong></p>

<p>Join the class CS24_w18 on submit.cs.</p>

<p>Submit using the command:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ ~submit/submit -p 918 hello.cpp
</code></pre>

<p>Motivation for using github: When developing large programs, it is very useful to save working versions of your code that you can always revert to. Trying to do this manually often leads to total chaos!! That’s why professional programmers use some kind of version control system (VCS). We will use a popular VCS called Git. With Git all versions of your code will be available to you and your collaborators (in later labs this would be your pair-programming partner) anytime, anywhere! It will also help the course staff view your progress as you work on the assignments.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Before we begin, read this article to get an overview of git: <a href="https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/git_overview/">https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/git_overview/</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You will now create a git repo. The concept of a repo was explained in the article that you just read. New projects always start with this step. Since Github promotes “open source” projects, repos created under your default github account are <em>public</em>. This means that they are visible to everyone on the internet. However, for this class your assignments have to be “closed source”, and not open to your classmates and others on the internet. This requires that you create <em>private</em> repos. These are repos that are only visible to you, your pair-partner and the instructional staff. You can only create private repos within our class organization on github: ucsb-cs24-sp17. So, the next step is to join our class organization.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read this article on <a href="https://ucsb-cs16.github.io/topics/github_com_create_private_repo_under_org/">creating a github repo under an organization</a>. Open a browser and navigate to our class organization on github: <a href="https://github.com/orgs/ucsb-cs24-w18/dashboard">ucsb-cs24-w18</a>. Click on the green button that says “New repository”, and follow the steps from the <a href="https://ucsb-cs24.github.io/topics/github_com_create_private_repo_under_org/">“creating a github repo under an organization”</a> article, to create a PRIVATE repo containing only a README.md and a .gitignore. See screenshot below:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/lab/lab00/enter-org/pic5.png" alt="new-repo" height="500px" /></p>

<p>Your repo name should be lab00_your-github-username. For example if your github username is jgaucho, you should name your repo as lab00_jgaucho. Make sure you select the PRIVATE option when creating your repo.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Check to see if you have the files: README.txt and .gitignore in your repo. If you don’t see these files, contact an instructor or ask for help on Piazza. To learn more about the .gitignore, read this article: <a href="https://ucsb-cs56-pconrad.github.io/topics/git_gitignore/">About gitignore</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use github’s web interface to edit the README file. In the README, add your and your partners name and perm number. If you don’t know how to do this yet, wait until I demonstrate it in the next lecture. You may proceed to the next step</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Upload your hello.cpp file. To do this step you should be physically present on a lab machine or in CSIL where you have access to a web browser and a local copy of your hello.cpp program. On your web browser, navigate to your repo on github. If your repo name is lab00_jgaucho, the link to the repo is: https://github.com/ucsb-cs24-w18/lab00_jgaucho. Click on the “Upload files” button as shown below.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/lab/lab00/git-repo-pic_ink-upload.jpg" alt="git-file-upload" height="500px" /></p>

<p>You should see the following screen:</p>

<p><img src="/lab/lab00/upload-hello-cpp.png" alt="git-upload-hello" height="500px" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Now either drag and drop the “hello.cpp” file from your machine or use the “Choose your files” option to browse through your local directory and upload the file. Then press the green “Commit new files” button. Navigate back to your repo to see that the hello.cpp file is correctly listed along with the other files. Click on it and you should see your code on github’s web interface. Continue to explore the web interface of your github repo. For example, try clicking on the “commits” link in your repo. What does that show you and what do you think it means?</li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations on completing your introductory exercise to github. We will continue to explore git in the subsequent assignments.</p>
