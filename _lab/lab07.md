This lab must be completed individually.

As you may know, we ran a pilot mentor program this quarter.
We would like to get your feedback about the program to help us keep the aspects that worked well and identify areas for improvement.

Completing the survey carries course credit (1% of your overall grade), so please be sure to complete it. This is an anonymous survey. To get credit please show the final screen  to the instructor TA/tutor

Here is the link to the survey:
